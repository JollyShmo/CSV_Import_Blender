[![download](https://github.com/JollyShmo/CSV_Import_Blender/blob/Beta/version_csv_import_beta2.png)](https://github.com/JollyShmo/CSV_Import_Blender/releases/download/v4.2.1-beta/csv_mesh_importer.zip)

This Blender addon allows you to import a CSV file and it will auto create a 3d mesh by connected points, edges and faces. It's particularly useful for visualizing point data captured using tools like 'RenderDoc' to export the CSV file as a 3D Mesh. Works for a number of games including Bioshock Series, We Happy Few, and more.

`notes:` 

>```This addon creates a mesh with connected edges or faces based on the imported points. It's important to review the results and refine the mesh as needed after import.```

```‚ö† This is optimized for games that work with RenderDoc and the csv files it can export.```

- `Custom Imports: [Bioshock 1 & 2 + WHF +] should be the default when trying a new game not listed. You can also use [Other].` 

- `[Bioshock INF +] is only last resort. It is better to use Other in some cases.`

- `(TEXTURE.x, TEXTURE.y) currently only works under [Other]!`
